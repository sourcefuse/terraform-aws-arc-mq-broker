# Terraform AWS ARC Broker MQ Module Usage Guide

## Introduction

### Purpose of the Document

This document provides guidelines and instructions for users looking to implement the Terraform module for supporting AWS Broker MQ

### Module Overview

The [terraform-aws-arc-mq-broker](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-mq-broker) to implement Terraform module for setting up an OpenSearch cluster

### Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have the following:

- AWS credentials configured.
- Terraform installed.
- A working knowledge of AWS VPC, Borker MQ, and Terraform concepts.

## Getting Started

### Module Source

To use the module in your Terraform configuration, include the following source block:

```hcl
module "arc-mq-broker" {
  source              = "sourcefuse/arc-mq-broker/aws"
  version             = "0.0.1"
  broker_name         = var.broker_name
  broker_type         = var.broker_type
  engine_version      = var.engine_version
  host_instance_type  = var.host_instance_type
  subnet_ids          = var.subnet_ids
  security_group_name = var.security_group_name
  deployment_mode     = var.deployment_mode
  users               = var.users
  enable_logging      = var.enable_logging
  ingress_rules       = var.ingress_rules
  egress_rules        = var.egress_rules
  tags                = module.tags.tags
}
```

Refer to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/sourcefuse/arc-ecs/aws/latest) for the latest version.

### Integration with Existing Terraform Configurations

Refer to the Terraform Registry for the latest version.

## Integration with Existing Terraform Configurations
Integrate the module with your existing Terraform mono repo configuration, follow the steps below:

- Create a new folder in terraform/ named brokermq.
- Create the required files, see the [example](https://github.com/sourcefuse/terraform-aws-arc-mq-broker/tree/main/example) to base off of.
- Configure with your backend:
   - **region**: Where the backend resides
    - **key**: `<working_directory>/terraform.tfstate`
    - **bucket**: Bucket name where the terraform state will reside
    - **dynamodb_table**: Lock table so there are not duplicate tfplans in the mix
    - **encrypt**: Encrypt all traffic to and from the backend

### Required AWS Permissions

Ensure that the AWS credentials used to execute Terraform have the necessary permissions to create an AWS Broker MQ.
